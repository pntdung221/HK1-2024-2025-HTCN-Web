                        Scrapbook albums have existed since the
                        beginning of photography. However, the sad
                        fact is that photographs and most printed
                        material are not permanent: they will fade and
                        yellow with age. Scrapbookers of today are
                        aware of these problems, and the industry is
                        providing remedies to minimize deterioration.
                        For the best results, avoid using materials with
                        high acid content which can cause photos and
                        paper to deteriorate. Another thing to avoid is
                        lignin, a material that is the bonding element in wood fibers. Over time, paper with lignin will
                        become yellow and brittle, so you should only use lignin-free products
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-text-2">
                        Your albums should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges, oil, and dirt that
                        can be transferred from your hands. You should never use albums with sticky "magnetic" pages.
                        The sticky substance will be transferred to the photo and backing paper causing deterioration.
                        Never crop Polaroid photos: they will curl and fall apart. Mount all memorabilia on acid-free
                        cardstock paper, and photocopy all newspaper clippings on acid-free paper.
